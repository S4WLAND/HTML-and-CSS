**CSS Essentials Playground** is my interactive notebook for mastering CSS—from basic selectors to responsive layouts, shadows, gradients, and slick animations.  
Every concept lives in its own *mini-demo* (HTML + CSS) so I can tweak values, save, and see the magic instantly in the browser.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- 🏷️ **Advanced Selectors** – combinators, attributes, pseudo-classes  
- 📏 **Units & Sizing** – `px`, `%`, `em`, `rem`, viewport units  
- 🌈 **Colors & Transparency** – `rgb/rgba`, `hsl/hsla`, hex codes  
- 📦 **Box Model** – margins, padding, borders, overflow control  
- 🧭 **Floats & Clearfix** – old-school layout tricks worth knowing  
- 👻 **Visibility & Display** – `display`, `visibility`, `opacity`, z-index  
- ✨ **Pseudo-elements** – decorating with `::before` & `::after`  
- 🖋️ **Web Fonts** – `@font-face`, Google Fonts, typography basics  
- 🌠 **Shadows & Gradients** – multiple `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`, linear & radial gradients  
- 🎬 **Transforms & Transitions** – translate, rotate, scale & smooth state changes  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – media queries, mobile-first workflow
